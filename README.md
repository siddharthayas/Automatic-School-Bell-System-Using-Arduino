# Automatic School Bell System

This project automates the school bell system using an Arduino-based setup. The system rings the bell at specific intervals throughout the day, based on a predefined schedule stored in the DS3231 RTC module. It displays the current time and date on an LCD screen, and the relay module controls the bell. This setup eliminates manual operation, ensuring that the bell rings accurately at the right times. The system is also flexible, allowing for time adjustments as needed.
